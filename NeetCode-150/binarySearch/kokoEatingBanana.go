//Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the i-th pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours. Koko can decide how many bananas to eat per hour.
//Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.
//Help Koko find the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.
//Koko can eat any pile of bananas at a rate of k bananas per hour. If the pile has less than k bananas, she will eat all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during that hour.
//Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.
//Example 1:
//Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
//Output: 4
//Explenation: Koko can eat 4 bananas per hour. She can finish eating the first pile in 1 hour, the second pile in 2 hours, the third pile in 2 hours, and the last pile in 3 hours. So the total time is 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8.
